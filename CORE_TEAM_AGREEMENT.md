## Current core team

 - Mikko Korpela

## Rules

Default method of decision making is consent.
This means that in the absense of objections
a decision is made.

Any one of the core team members can raise an objection.

If an objection is raised, we agree a time and place to 
discuss the matter in an online meeting.
If no consensus is achieved we will vote.
Each team member gets one vote. Majority wins the vote.
Vote can be made public if one of the team members requests it.

## Adding a new team member

A new member to the team requires that all current team members support this.

## Removing a team member

Anyone can leave the team by his own will.
If all others from the core team agree that a team member should be removed from the team
then that team member will no longer be part of the core team.

## Signed by:

We agree on all of this by commiting a signed commit `git commit -S` on this file
that adds signers name here:
