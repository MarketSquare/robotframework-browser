These arguments can be used to write readable multiline JavaScript. |\n        | ``arg`` | an additional argument that can be handed over to the JavaScript function. This argument must be JSON serializable. ElementHandles are not supported. |\n        | ``all_elements`` | defines if only the single elementHandle found by ``selector`` is handed over to the function or if set to ``True`` all found elements are handed over as array. |\n\n        Example with ``all_elements=True``:\n        |  ${texts}=    Evaluate JavaScript    button\n        |  ...    (elements, arg) => {\n        |  ...        let text = []\n        |  ...            for (e of elements) {\n        |  ...                console.log(e.innerText)\n        |  ...                text.push(e.innerText)\n        |  ...            }\n        |  ...        text.push(arg)\n        |  ...        return text\n        |  ...    }\n        |  ...    all_elements=True\n        |  ...    arg=Just another Text\n\n        Keyword uses strict mode if ``all_elements`` is ``False``.

        "doc": "1 Browser library is a browser automation library for Robot Framework.\n\n    This is the keyword documentation for Browser library. For information\n    about installation, support, and more please visit the\n    [https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-playwright|project pages].\n    For more information about Robot Framework itself, see [https://robotframework.org|robotframework.org].\n\n    Browser library uses\n    [https://github.com/microsoft/playwright|Playwright Node module]\n    to automate [https://www.chromium.org/Home|Chromium],\n    [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/|Firefox]\n    and [https://webkit.org/|WebKit] with a single library.\n\n\n    == Table of contents ==\n\n    %TOC%\n\n    = Browser, Context and Page =\n\n    Browser library works with three different layers that build on each other:\n    *Browser*, *Context* and *Page*.\n\n\n    == Browsers ==\n\n    A *browser* can be started with one of the three\n    different engines Chromium, Firefox or Webkit.\n\n    === Supported Browsers ===\n\n    |   Browser     | Browser with this engine                          |\n    | ``chromium``  | Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (since 2020), Opera |\n    | ``firefox``   | Mozilla Firefox                                   |\n    | ``webkit``    | Apple Safari, Mail, AppStore on MacOS and iOS     |\n\n    Since [https://github.com/microsoft/playwright|Playwright] comes with a pack of builtin\n    binaries for all browsers, no additional drivers e.g. geckodriver are needed.\n\n    All these browsers that cover more than 85% of the world wide used browsers,\n    can be tested on Windows, Linux and MacOS.\n    There is no need for dedicated machines anymore.\n\n    A browser process is started ``headless`` (without a GUI) by default.\n    Run `New Browser` with specified arguments if a browser with a GUI is requested\n    or if a proxy has to be configured.\n    A browser process can contain several contexts.\n\n\n    == Contexts ==\n\n    A *context* corresponds to a set of independent incognito pages in a browser\n    that share cookies, sessions or profile settings. Pages in two separate\n    contexts do not share cookies, sessions or profile settings.\n    Compared to Selenium, these do *not* require their own browser process.\n    To get a clean environment a test can just open a new context.\n    Due to this new independent browser sessions can be opened with\n    Robot Framework Browser about 10 times faster than with Selenium by\n    just opening a `New Context` within the opened browser.\n\n    To make pages in the same suite share state, use the same context by opening the\n    context with `New Context` on suite setup.\n\n    The context layer is useful e.g. for testing different user sessions on the\n    same webpage without opening a whole new browser context.\n    Contexts can also have detailed configurations, such as geo-location, language settings,\n    the viewport size or color scheme.\n    Contexts do also support http credentials to be set, so that basic authentication\n    can also be tested. To be able to download files within the test,\n    the ``acceptDownloads`` argument must be set to ``True`` in `New Context` keyword.\n    A context can contain different pages.\n\n\n    == Pages ==\n\n    A *page* does contain the content of the loaded web site and has a browsing history.\n    Pages and browser tabs are the same.\n\n    Typical usage could be:\n    | *** Test Cases ***\n    | Starting a browser with a page\n    |     New Browser    chromium    headless=false\n    |     New Context    viewport={'width': 1920, 'height': 1080}\n    |     New Page       https://marketsquare.github.io/robotframework-browser/Browser.html\n    |     Get Title      ==    Browser\n\n    The `Open Browser` keyword opens a new browser, a new context and a new page.\n    This keyword is useful for quick experiments or debugging sessions.\n\n    When a `New Page` is called without an open browser, `New Browser`\n    and `New Context` are executed with default values first.\n\n    Each Browser, Context and Page has a unique ID with which they can be addressed.\n    A full catalog of what is open can be received by `Get Browser Catalog` as a dictionary.\n\n    = Automatic page and context closing =\n\n    %AUTO_CLOSING_LEVEL%\n\n    = Finding elements =\n\n    All keywords in the library that need to interact with an element\n    on a web page take an argument typically named ``selector`` that specifies\n    how to find the element. Keywords can find elements with strict mode. If\n    strict mode is true and locator finds multiple elements from the page, keyword\n    will fail. If keyword finds one element, keyword does not fail because of\n    strict mode. If strict mode is false, keyword does not fail if selector points\n    many elements. Strict mode is enabled by default, but can be changed in library\n    `importing` or `Set Strict Mode` keyword. Keyword documentation states if keyword\n    uses strict mode. If keyword does not state that strict mode is used, then strict\n    mode is not applied for the keyword. For more details, see Playwright\n    [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-query-selector|strict documentation].\n\n    Selector strategies that are supported by default are listed in the table\n    below.\n\n    | = Strategy = |     = Match based on =     |         = Example =                |\n    | ``css``      | CSS selector.              | ``css=.class > \\#login_btn``      |\n    | ``xpath``    | XPath expression.          | ``xpath=//input[@id=\"login_btn\"]`` |\n    | ``text``     | Browser text engine.       | ``text=Login``                     |\n    | ``id``       | Element ID Attribute.      | ``id=login_btn``                   |\n\n    CSS Selectors can also be recorded with `Record selector` keyword.\n\n    == Explicit Selector Strategy ==\n\n    The explicit selector strategy is specified with a prefix using syntax\n    ``strategy=value``. Spaces around the separator are ignored, so\n    ``css=foo``, ``css= foo`` and ``css = foo`` are all equivalent.\n\n\n    == Implicit Selector Strategy ==\n\n    *The default selector strategy is `css`.*\n\n    If selector does not contain one of the know explicit selector strategies, it is\n    assumed to contain css selector.\n\n    Selectors that are starting with ``//`` or ``..`` are considered as xpath selectors.\n\n    Selectors that are in quotes are considered as text selectors.\n\n    Examples:\n\n    | # CSS selectors are default.\n    | `Click`  span > button.some_class         # This is equivalent\n    | `Click`  css=span > button.some_class     # to this.\n    |\n    | # // or .. leads to xpath selector strategy\n    | `Click`  //span/button[@class=\"some_class\"]\n    | `Click`  xpath=//span/button[@class=\"some_class\"]\n    |\n    | # \"text\" in quotes leads to exact text selector strategy\n    | `Click`  \"Login\"\n    | `Click`  text=\"Login\"\n\n\n    == CSS ==\n\n    As written before, the default selector strategy is `css`. See\n    [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors | css selector]\n    for more information.\n\n    Any malformed selector not starting with ``//`` or ``..`` nor starting and ending\n    with a quote is assumed to be a css selector.\n\n    Note that ``#`` is a comment character in [https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#ignored-data | Robot Framework syntax] and needs to be\n    escaped like ``\\#`` to work as a [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors | css ID selector].\n\n    Examples:\n    | `Click`  span > button.some_class\n    | `Get Text`  \\#username_field  ==  George\n\n\n    == XPath ==\n\n    XPath engine is equivalent to [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Document/evaluate|Document.evaluate].\n    Example: ``xpath=//html/body//span[text()=\"Hello World\"]``.\n\n    Malformed selector starting with ``//`` or ``..`` is assumed to be an xpath selector.\n    For example, ``//html/body`` is converted to ``xpath=//html/body``. More\n    examples are displayed in `Examples`.\n\n    Note that xpath does not pierce [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM|shadow_roots].\n\n\n    == Text ==\n\n    Text engine finds an element that contains a text node with the passed text.\n    For example, ``Click    text=Login`` clicks on a login button, and\n    ``Wait For Elements State   text=\"lazy loaded text\"`` waits for the \"lazy loaded text\"\n    to appear in the page.\n\n    Text engine finds fields based on their labels in text inserting keywords.\n\n    Malformed selector starting and ending with a quote (either ``\"`` or ``'``) is assumed\n    to be a text selector. For example, ``Click    \"Login\"`` is converted to ``Click    text=\"Login\"``.\n    Be aware that these leads to exact matches only!\n    More examples are displayed in `Examples`.\n\n\n    === Insensitive match ===\n\n    By default, the match is case-insensitive, ignores leading/trailing whitespace and\n    searches for a substring. This means ``text= Login`` matches\n    ``<button>Button loGIN (click me)</button>``.\n\n    === Exact match ===\n\n    Text body can be escaped with single or double quotes for precise matching,\n    insisting on exact match, including specified whitespace and case.\n    This means ``text=\"Login \"`` will only match ``<button>Login </button>`` with exactly\n    one space after \"Login\". Quoted text follows the usual escaping rules, e.g.\n    use ``\\\"`` to escape double quote in a double-quoted string: ``text=\"foo\\\"bar\"``.\n\n    === RegEx ===\n\n    Text body can also be a JavaScript-like regex wrapped in / symbols.\n    This means ``text=/^hello .*!$/i`` or ``text=/^Hello .*!$/`` will match ``<span>Hello Peter Parker!</span>``\n    with any name after ``Hello``, ending with ``!``.\n    The first one flagged with ``i`` for case-insensitive.\n    See [https://regex101.com/|https://regex101.com] for more information about RegEx.\n\n    === Button and Submit Values ===\n\n    Input elements of the type button and submit are rendered with their value as text,\n    and text engine finds them. For example, ``text=Login`` matches\n    ``<input type=button value=\"Login\">``.\n\n    == Cascaded selector syntax ==\n\n    Browser library supports the same selector strategies as the underlying\n    Playwright node module: xpath, css, id and text. The strategy can either\n    be explicitly specified with a prefix or the strategy can be implicit.\n\n    A major advantage of Browser is that multiple selector engines can be used\n    within one selector. It is possible to mix XPath, CSS and Text selectors while\n    selecting a single element.\n\n    Selectors are strings that consists of one or more clauses separated by\n    ``>>`` token, e.g. ``clause1 >> clause2 >> clause3``. When multiple clauses\n    are present, next one is queried relative to the previous one's result.\n    Browser library supports concatenation of different selectors separated by ``>>``.\n\n    For example:\n    | `Highlight Elements`    \"Hello\" >> ../.. >> .select_button\n    | `Highlight Elements`    text=Hello >> xpath=../.. >> css=.select_button\n\n    Each clause contains a selector engine name and selector body, e.g.\n    ``engine=body``. Here ``engine`` is one of the supported engines (e.g. css or\n    a custom one). Selector ``body`` follows the format of the particular engine,\n    e.g. for css engine it should be a [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors | css selector].\n    Body format is assumed to ignore leading and trailing white spaces,\n    so that extra whitespace can be added for readability. If the selector\n    engine needs to include ``>>`` in the body, it should be escaped\n    inside a string to not be confused with clause separator,\n    e.g. ``text=\"some >> text\"``.\n\n    Selector engine name can be prefixed with ``*`` to capture an element that\n    matches the particular clause instead of the last one. For example,\n    ``css=article >> text=Hello`` captures the element with the text ``Hello``,\n    and ``*css=article >> text=Hello`` (note the *) captures the article element\n    that contains some element with the text Hello.\n\n    For convenience, selectors in the wrong format are heuristically converted\n    to the right format. See `Implicit Selector Strategy`\n\n    == Examples ==\n    | # queries 'div' css selector\n    | Get Element    css=div\n    |\n    | # queries '//html/body/div' xpath selector\n    | Get Element    //html/body/div\n    |\n    | # queries '\"foo\"' text selector\n    | Get Element    text=foo\n    |\n    | # queries 'span' css selector inside the result of '//html/body/div' xpath selector\n    | Get Element    xpath=//html/body/div >> css=span\n    |\n    | # converted to 'css=div'\n    | Get Element    div\n    |\n    | # converted to 'xpath=//html/body/div'\n    | Get Element    //html/body/div\n    |\n    | # converted to 'text=\"foo\"'\n    | Get Element    \"foo\"\n    |\n    | # queries the div element of every 2nd span element inside an element with the id foo\n    | Get Element    \\#foo >> css=span:nth-child(2n+1) >> div\n    | Get Element    id=foo >> css=span:nth-child(2n+1) >> div\n\n    Be aware that using ``#`` as a starting character in Robot Framework would be interpreted as comment.\n    Due to that fact a ``#id`` must be escaped as ``\\#id``.\n\n    == iFrames ==\n\n    By default, selector chains do not cross frame boundaries. It means that a\n    simple CSS selector is not able to select an element located inside an iframe\n    or a frameset. For this use case, there is a special selector ``>>>`` which can\n    be used to combine a selector for the frame and a selector for an element\n    inside a frame.\n\n    Given this simple pseudo html snippet:\n    | <iframe id=\"iframe\" src=\"src.html\">\n    |   #document\n    |     <!DOCTYPE html>\n    |     <html>\n    |       <head></head>\n    |       <body>\n    |         <button id=\"btn\">Click Me</button>\n    |       </body>\n    |     </html>\n    | </iframe>\n\n    Here's a keyword call that clicks the button inside the frame.\n\n    | Click   id=iframe >>> id=btn\n\n    The selectors on the left and right side of ``>>>`` can be any valid selectors.\n    The selector clause directly before the frame opener ``>>>`` must select the frame element itself.\n    Frame selection is the only place where Browser Library modifies the selector, as explained in above.\n    In all cases, the library does not alter the selector in any way, instead it is passed as is to the\n    Playwright side.\n\n    If multiple keyword shall be performed inside a frame,\n    it is possible to define a selector prefix with `Set Selector Prefix`.\n    If this prefix is set to a frame/iframe it has similar behavior as SeleniumLibrary keyword `Select Frame`.\n\n    == WebComponents and Shadow DOM ==\n\n    Playwright and so also Browser are able to do automatic piercing of Shadow DOMs\n    and therefore are the best automation technology when working with WebComponents.\n\n    Also other technologies claim that they can handle\n    [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM|Shadow DOM and Web Components].\n    However, none of them do pierce shadow roots automatically,\n    which may be inconvenient when working with Shadow DOM and Web Components.\n\n    For that reason, the css engine pierces shadow roots. More specifically, every\n    [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator|Descendant combinator]\n    pierces an arbitrary number of open shadow roots, including the implicit descendant combinator\n    at the start of the selector.\n\n    That means, it is not necessary to select each shadow host, open its shadow root and\n    select the next shadow host until you reach the element that should be controlled.\n\n    === CSS:light ===\n\n    ``css:light`` engine is equivalent to [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector | Document.querySelector]\n    and behaves according to the CSS spec.\n    However, it does not pierce shadow roots.\n\n    ``css`` engine first searches for elements in the light dom in the iteration order,\n    and then recursively inside open shadow roots in the iteration order. It does not\n    search inside closed shadow roots or iframes.\n\n    Examples:\n\n    | <article>\n    |   <div>In the light dom</div>\n    |   <div slot='myslot'>In the light dom, but goes into the shadow slot</div>\n    |   <open mode shadow root>\n    |       <div class='in-the-shadow'>\n    |           <span class='content'>\n    |               In the shadow dom\n    |               <open mode shadow root>\n    |                   <li id='target'>Deep in the shadow</li>\n    |               </open mode shadow root>\n    |           </span>\n    |       </div>\n    |       <slot name='myslot'></slot>\n    |   </open mode shadow root>\n    | </article>\n\n    Note that ``<open mode shadow root>`` is not an html element, but rather a shadow root\n    created with ``element.attachShadow({mode: 'open'})``.\n\n    - Both ``\"css=article div\"`` and ``\"css:light=article div\"`` match the first ``<div>In the light dom</div>``.\n    - Both ``\"css=article > div\"`` and ``\"css:light=article > div\"`` match two ``div`` elements that are direct children of the ``article``.\n    - ``\"css=article .in-the-shadow\"`` matches the ``<div class='in-the-shadow'>``, piercing the shadow root, while ``\"css:light=article .in-the-shadow\"`` does not match anything.\n    - ``\"css:light=article div > span\"`` does not match anything, because both light-dom ``div`` elements do not contain a ``span``.\n    - ``\"css=article div > span\"`` matches the ``<span class='content'>``, piercing the shadow root.\n    - ``\"css=article > .in-the-shadow\"`` does not match anything, because ``<div class='in-the-shadow'>`` is not a direct child of ``article``\n    - ``\"css:light=article > .in-the-shadow\"`` does not match anything.\n    - ``\"css=article li#target\"`` matches the ``<li id='target'>Deep in the shadow</li>``, piercing two shadow roots.\n\n    === text:light ===\n\n    ``text`` engine open pierces shadow roots similarly to ``css``, while ``text:light`` does not.\n    Text engine first searches for elements in the light dom in the iteration order, and then\n    recursively inside open shadow roots in the iteration order. It does not search inside\n    closed shadow roots or iframes.\n\n    === id, data-testid, data-test-id, data-test and their :light counterparts ===\n\n    Attribute engines are selecting based on the corresponding attribute value.\n    For example: ``data-test-id=foo`` is equivalent to ``css=[data-test-id=\"foo\"]``,\n    and ``id:light=foo`` is equivalent to ``css:light=[id=\"foo\"]``.\n\n    == Element reference syntax ==\n\n    It is possible to get a reference to a Locator by using `Get Element` and `Get Elements` keywords.\n    Keywords do not save reference to an element in the HTML document, instead it saves reference to a Playwright\n    [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator|Locator]. In nutshell Locator captures the logic of how to\n    retrieve that element from the page. Each time an action is performed, the locator re-searches the elements\n    in the page. This reference can be used as a *first* part of a selector by using a special selector\n    syntax `element=`. like this:\n\n    | ${ref}=    Get Element    .some_class\n    |            Click          ${ref} >> .some_child     # Locator searches an element from the page.\n    |            Click          ${ref} >> .other_child    # Locator searches again an element from the page.\n\n    The `.some_child` and `.other_child` selectors in the example are relative to the element referenced\n    by ${ref}. Please note that frame piercing is not possible with element reference.\n\n    = Assertions =\n\n    Keywords that accept arguments ``assertion_operator`` <`AssertionOperator`> and ``assertion_expected``\n    can optionally assert that a specified condition holds. Keywords will return the value even when the\n    assertion is performed by the keyword.\n\n    Assert will retry and fail only after a specified timeout.\n    See `Importing` and ``retry_assertions_for`` (default is 1 second) for configuring this timeout.\n\n\n    %ASSERTION_TABLE%\n\n    By default, keywords will provide an error message if an assertion fails.\n    Default error messages can be overwritten with a ``message`` argument.\n    The ``message`` argument accepts `{value}`, `{value_type}`, `{expected}` and\n    `{expected_type}` [https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format|format]\n    options.\n    The `{value}` is the value returned by the keyword and the `{expected}`\n    is the expected value defined by the user, usually the value in the\n    ``assertion_expected`` argument. The `{value_type}` and\n    `{expected_type}` are the type definitions from `{value}` and `{expected}`\n    arguments. In similar fashion as Python\n    [https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type|type] returns type definition.\n    Assertions will retry until ``timeout`` has expired if they do not pass.\n\n    The assertion ``assertion_expected`` value is not converted by the library and\n    is used as is. Therefore when assertion is made, the ``assertion_expected``\n    argument value and value returned the keyword must have the same type. If types\n    are not the same, assertion will fail. Example `Get Text` always returns a string\n    and has to be compared with a string, even the returned value might look like\n    a number.\n\n    Other Keywords have other specific types they return.\n    `Get Element Count` always returns an integer.\n    `Get Bounding Box` and `Get Viewport Size` can be filtered.\n    They return a dictionary without a filter and a number when filtered.\n    These Keywords do automatic conversion for the expected value if a number is returned.\n\n    * < less or greater > With Strings*\n    Comparisons of strings with ``greater than`` or ``less than`` compares each character,\n    starting from 0 regarding where it stands in the code page.\n    Example: ``A < Z``, ``Z < a``, ``ac < dc`\n    It does never compare the length of elements. Neither lists nor strings.\n    The comparison stops at the first character that is different.\n    Examples: ``'abcde' < 'abd'``, ``'100.000' < '2'``\n    In Python 3 and therefore also in Browser it is not possible to compare numbers\n    with strings with a greater or less operator.\n    On keywords that return numbers, the given expected value is automatically\n    converted to a number before comparison.\n\n\n    The getters `Get Page State` and `Get Browser Catalog` return a dictionary. Values of the dictionary can directly asserted.\n    Pay attention of possible types because they are evaluated in Python. For example:\n\n    | Get Page State    validate    2020 >= value['year']                     # Comparison of numbers\n    | Get Page State    validate    \"IMPORTANT MESSAGE!\" == value['message']  # Comparison of strings\n\n    == The 'then' or 'evaluate' closure ==\n\n    Keywords that accept arguments ``assertion_operator`` and ``assertion_expected``\n    can optionally also use ``then`` or ``evaluate`` closure to modify the returned value with\n    BuiltIn Evaluate. Actual value can be accessed with ``value``.\n\n    For example ``Get Title  then  'TITLE: '+value``.\n    See\n    [https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html#Evaluating%20expressions|\n    Builtin Evaluating expressions]\n    for more info on the syntax.\n\n    == Examples ==\n\n    | # *Keyword*    *Selector*                    *Key*        *Assertion Operator*    *Assertion Expected*\n    | Get Title                                           equal                 Page Title\n    | Get Title                                           ^=                    Page\n    | Get Style    //*[@id=\"div-element\"]      width      >                     100\n    | Get Title                                           matches               \\\\w+\\\\s\\\\w+\n    | Get Title                                           validate              value == \"Login Page\"\n    | Get Title                                           evaluate              value if value == \"some value\" else \"something else\"\n\n\n    = Implicit waiting =\n\n    Browser library and Playwright have many mechanisms to help in waiting for elements.\n    Playwright will auto-wait before performing actions on elements.\n    Please see [https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability/ | Auto-waiting on Playwright documentation]\n    for more information.\n\n    On top of Playwright auto-waiting Browser assertions will wait and retry\n    for specified time before failing any `Assertions`.\n    Time is specified in Browser library initialization with ``retry_assertions_for``.\n\n    Browser library also includes explicit waiting keywords such as `Wait for Elements State`\n    if more control for waiting is needed.\n\n    = Experimental: Re-using same node process =\n\n    Browser library integrated nodejs and python. The NodeJS side can be also executed as a standalone process.\n    Browser libraries running on the same machine can talk to that instead of starting new node processes.\n    This can speed execution when running tests parallel.\n    To start node side run on the directory when the Browser package is\n    ``PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0 node Browser/wrapper/index.js PORT``.\n\n    ``PORT`` is the port you want to use for the node process.\n    To execute tests then with pabot for example do ``ROBOT_FRAMEWORK_BROWSER_NODE_PORT=PORT pabot ..``.\n\n    = Experimental: Provide parameters to node process =\n\n    Browser library is integrated with NodeJSand and Python. Browser library starts a node process, to communicate\n    Playwright API in NodeJS side. It is possible to provide parameters for the started node process by defining\n    ROBOT_FRAMEWORK_BROWSER_NODE_DEBUG_OPTIONS environment variable, before starting the test execution. Example:\n    ``ROBOT_FRAMEWORK_BROWSER_NODE_DEBUG_OPTIONS=--inspect;robot path/to/tests``.\n    There can be multiple arguments defined in the environment variable and arguments must be separated with comma.\n\n    = Scope Setting =\n\n    Some keywords which manipulates library settings have a scope argument.\n    With that scope argument one can set the \"live time\" of that setting.\n    Available Scopes are: `Global`, `Suite` and `Test`/`Task`\n    See `Scope`.\n    Is a scope finished, this scoped setting, like timeout, will no longer be used.\n\n    Live Times:\n    - A `Global` scope will live forever until it is overwritten by another `Global` scope. Or locally temporarily overridden by a more narrow scope.\n    - A `Suite` scope will locally override the `Global` scope and live until the end of the Suite within it is set, or if it is overwritten by a later setting with `Global` or same scope. Children suite does inherit the setting from the parent suite but also may have its own local `Suite` setting that then will be inherited to its children suites.\n    - A `Test` or `Task` scope will be inherited from its parent suite but when set, lives until the end of that particular test or task.\n\n    A new set higher order scope will always remove the lower order scope which may be in charge.\n    So the setting of a `Suite` scope from a test, will set that scope to the robot file suite where that test is and removes the `Test` scope that may have been in place.\n\n    = Extending Browser library with a JavaScript module =\n\n    Browser library can be extended with JavaScript. The module must be in CommonJS format that Node.js uses.\n    You can translate your ES6 module to Node.js CommonJS style with Babel. Many other languages\n    can be also translated to modules that can be used from Node.js. For example TypeScript, PureScript and\n    ClojureScript just to mention few.\n\n    | async function myGoToKeyword(url, args, page, logger, playwright) {\n    |   logger(args.toString())\n    |   playwright.coolNewFeature()\n    |   return await page.goto(url);\n    | }\n\n    Functions can contain any number of arguments and arguments may have default values.\n\n    There are some reserved arguments that are not accessible from Robot Framework side.\n    They are injected to the function if they are in the arguments:\n\n    ``page``: [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page|the playwright Page object].\n\n    ``args``: the rest of values from Robot Framework keyword call ``*args``.\n\n    ``logger``: callback function that takes strings as arguments and writes them to robot log. Can be called multiple times.\n\n    ``playwright``: playwright module (* from 'playwright'). Useful for integrating with Playwright features that Browser library doesn't support with it's own keywords. [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright| API docs]\n\n    also argument name ``self`` can not be used.\n\n    == Example module.js ==\n\n    | async function myGoToKeyword(pageUrl, page) {\n    |   await page.goto(pageUrl);\n    |   return await page.title();\n    | }\n    | exports.__esModule = true;\n    | exports.myGoToKeyword = myGoToKeyword;\n\n    == Example Robot Framework side ==\n\n    | *** Settings ***\n    | Library   Browser  jsextension=${CURDIR}/module.js\n    |\n    | *** Test Cases ***\n    | Hello\n    |   New Page\n    |   ${title}=  myGoToKeyword  https://playwright.dev\n    |   Should be equal  ${title}  Playwright\n\n    Also selector syntax can be extended with a custom selector using a js module\n\n    == Example module keyword for custom selector registering ==\n\n    | async function registerMySelector(playwright) {\n    | playwright.selectors.register(\"myselector\", () => ({\n    |    // Returns the first element matching given selector in the root's subtree.\n    |    query(root, selector) {\n    |       return root.querySelector(`a[data-title=\"${selector}\"]`);\n    |     },\n    |\n    |     // Returns all elements matching given selector in the root's subtree.\n    |     queryAll(root, selector) {\n    |       return Array.from(root.querySelectorAll(`a[data-title=\"${selector}\"]`));\n    |     }\n    | }));\n    | return 1;\n    | }\n    | exports.__esModule = true;\n    | exports.registerMySelector = registerMySelector;\n\n    = Plugins =\n\n    Browser library offers plugins as a way to modify and add library keywords and modify some of the internal\n    functionality without creating a new library or hacking the source code. See plugin API\n    [https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-browser/blob/main/docs/plugins/README.md | documentation] for\n    further details.\n\n    = Language =\n\n    Browser library offers possibility to translate keyword names and documentation to new language. If language\n    is defined, Browser library will search from\n    [https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#module-search-path | module search path]\n    Python packages starting with `robotframework_browser_translation` by using\n    [https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins/ | Python pluging API]. Library\n    is using naming convention to find Python plugins. The packages must implement single API call, `get_language`\n    without any arguments. Method must return a dictionary containing two keys: `language` and `path`. The\n    language key value defines which language the package contains. Also value should match (case insentive)\n    the library init ``language`` parameter. The path parameter value should be full path to the translation file.\n    The file name or extension is not important, but data must be in json format. The keys of json are the\n    methods names, not the keyword names, which implements keywords. Value of key is json object which contains\n    two keys: `name` and `doc`. The `name` key contains the keyword translated name and `doc` contains keyword\n    translated documentation. Providing doc and name are optional, example translation json file can only provide\n    translations to keyword names or only to documentatin. But it is always recomended to provide translation\n    to both name and doc.\n\n    Default translation file, with English language can be created by running\n    `rfbrowser translation /path/to/translation.json` command. Command does not provide transltations to other\n    languages, it only provides easy way to create full list of translated kewyords and their documentation\n    with correct format. It is also possible to add keywords from library plugins and js extenstions by\n    providing `--plugings` and `--jsextension` arguments to command. Example:\n    `rfbrowser translation --plugings myplugin.SomePlugin --jsextension /path/ot/jsplugin.js /path/to/translation.json`\n    "
