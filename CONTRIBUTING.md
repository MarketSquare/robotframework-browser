# Development setup

## Source code organization

These are the directories containing source code and tests:

 - `Browser`, contains the Python source code for the actual Robot Framework test library.
 - `node/playwright-wrapper`, contains a wrapper for Playwright that implements the grpc protocol, implemented in TypeScript.
 - `node/dynamic-test-app`, contains a test application used in the acceptance tests, implemented in TypeScript + React.
 - `protobuf`, contains the Protocol Buffer definitions used by the communication between the library and Playwright wrapper.
 - `utest`, unit tests for the Python code.
 - `atest`, acceptance tests written with Robot Framework.

## Development environment

Install Python, nodejs and yarn.
- https://www.python.org/downloads/
- https://nodejs.org/
- https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

N.B. The minimum Python version is 3.7.

Run `python bootstrap.py` to create a virtual environment with correct dependencies.
After that, make sure to activate the virtual env before running other development commands.

```
python bootstrap.py
source .venv/bin/activate  # On linux and OSX
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows
```

[Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/index.html) is used as a task runner / build tool.

Other dependencies can be installed/updated with `inv deps`. This command installs and updates both Python and nodejs dependencies.
After dependencies are installed, run `inv build` to compile node code and gRPC protocol. Also this invoke command will create
Python stub file.

Run `inv -l` to get list of current build commands.

## Testing

There are both unit tests written with pytest and acceptance tests written with
Robot Framework. These can be run manually with `inv utest` and `inv atest`.
To run continuously pytests in a watch mode `inv utest-watch`.
To rerun failed tests you can use `inv atest-failed` The tests are also executed in a pre-push hook.

If there changes inv TypeScript side, remember to run `inv build` before executing unit or acceptance tests.

## Running tests in docker container

Docker container builds a clean install package. This can be used to check that a built package works correctly in a clean environment without development dependencies.

1. Build the container `inv docker`
2. Run tests mounted from host machine `inv docker-test`
3. See results in `atest/output`

## Releasing

### Prerequisite
1. Ensure tests and linting pass on CI
1. Check that you have permissions to release on Github and PyPi

### Install dependencies
Ensure generated code and types are up to date with `inv build`

### Set version number
Set `VERSION=<version>` and run `inv version <new_version>` to update the version
information to both Python and Node components. Version number should match to the
milestone to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-browser/milestones)

```
git add Browser/version.py
git add package.json
git add setup.py
git commit -m "Updateversion to: $VERSION"
```

Invoke command also creates old docs add the doc to the repo:
```
git add  docs/versions/Browser-*.html
git commit -m "Add old docs to repo."
git push
```

### Generate release notes
Set GitHub user information into shell variables to ease copy-pasting the following command:
```
GITHUB_USERNAME=<username>
GITHUB_PASSWORD=<password>
```

Generate a template for the release notes:
```
invoke release-notes -w -v $VERSION -u $GITHUB_USERNAME -p $GITHUB_PASSWORD
```

Fill the missing details in the generated release notes template.

Make sure that issues have correct information:
* All issues should have type (bug, enhancement or task) and priority set. Notice that issues with the task type are
automatically excluded from the release notes.
* Issue priorities should be consistent.
* Issue titles should be informative. Consistency is good here too, but no need to overdo it.

If information needs to be added or edited, its better to edit it in the issue tracker than in the generated release
notes. This allows re-generating the list of issues later if more issues are added.

Add, commit and push:
```
git add docs/releasenotes/Browser-$VERSION.rst
git commit -m "Release notes for $VERSION"
git push
```
Update later if necessary.

Also update Browser libdoc.

### Create release
1. Use `inv release` to create and release artifacts and upload to PyPi
2. [Create Github release](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-browser/releases/new)
3. Check that [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/robotframework-browser/) looks good.
4. Install package from PyPi and test that it works.

### Announce release
1. Announce new release, at least in Slack, [Forum](https://forum.robotframework.org/t/browser-library-releases/685) and user group mailing list.
1. Change version to dev `inv version <new_version>` example if release version is 1.4.0, then next version could be: `inv version 1.5.0-dev`

## Code style
Python code style is enforced with flake8 and black. These are executed in a
pre-commit hook, but can also be invoked manually with `inv lint-python`.

JS / TS code style is enforced with eslint. Lints are run in pre-commit hooks, but can be run manually with `inv lint-node`.

## Architecture

There are 3 different interfaces that the library is targeting to use in browser automation and testing:

1. User interface: Interactions with DOM elements.
2. Internals of a webapp: State, Cookies, Storage, Methods.
3. Requests & Responses: Interface between a browser and servers.

Python Library <--> [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) <---> [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any example files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request once you have sign-off from another developer. If you do not have
   permission to perform the merge, you may request the reviewer merges your pull request for you.
