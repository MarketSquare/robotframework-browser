# Development setup

## Source code organization

These are the directories containing source code and tests:

 - `Browser`, contains the Python source code for the actual Robot Framework test library.
 - `node/playwright-wrapper`, contains a wrapper for Playwright that implements the grpc protocol, implemented in TypeScript.
 - `node/dynamic-test-app`, contains a test application used in the acceptance tests, implemented in TypeScript + React.
 - `protobuf`, contains the Protocol Buffer definitions used by the communication between the library and Playwright wrapper.
 - `utest`, unit tests for the Python code.
 - `atest`, acceptance tests written with Robot Framework.

## Development environment

Install Python, nodejs and yarn.
- https://www.python.org/downloads/
- https://nodejs.org/
- https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

N.B. The minimum Python version is 3.7.

Run `python bootstrap.py` to create a virtual environment with correct dependencies.
After that, make sure to activate the virtual env before running other development commands.

```
python bootstrap.py
source .venv/bin/activate  # On linux and OSX
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows
```

[Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/index.html) is used as a task runner / build tool.

Activate your virtualenv and install `invoke` with

```
pip install invoke
```

Other dependencies can be installed/updated with `inv deps`. This command installs and updated both Python and nodejs dependencies.

Run `inv -l` to get list of current build commands.

## Testing

There are both unit tests written with pytest and acceptance tests written with
Robot Framework. These can be run manually with `inv utest` and `inv atest`.
To run continuously pytests in a watch mode `inv utest-watch`.
To rerun failed tests you can use `inv atest-failed` The tests are also executed in a pre-push hook.

## Running tests in docker container

Docker container builds a clean install package. This can be used to check that a built package works correctly in a clean environment without development dependencies.

1. Build the container `inv docker`
2. Run tests mounted from host machine `inv docker-test`
3. See results in `atest/output`

## Releasing
1. Ensure generated code and types are up to date with `inv build`
2. Ensure tests and linting pass on CI
3. Check that you have permissions to release on Github and PyPi
4. Run `inv <new_version>` to update the version information to both Python and Node components.
5. Use `inv release` to create and release artifacts and upload to PyPi
6. [Create Github release](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-browser/releases/new)

## Code style
Python code style is enforced with flake8 and black. These are executed in a
pre-commit hook, but can also be invoked manually with `inv lint-python`.

JS / TS code style is enforced with eslint. Lints are run in pre-commit hooks, but can be run manually with `inv lint-node`.

## Architecture

There are 3 different interfaces that the library is targeting to use in browser automation and testing:

1. User interface: Interactions with DOM elements.
2. Internals of a webapp: State, Cookies, Storage, Methods.
3. Requests & Responses: Interface between a browser and servers.

Python Library <--> [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) <---> [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any example files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request once you have sign-off from another developer. If you do not have
   permission to perform the merge, you may request the reviewer merges your pull request for you.
