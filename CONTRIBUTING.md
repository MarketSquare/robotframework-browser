# Development setup

## Source code organization

These are the directories containing source code and tests:

 - `Browser`, contains the Python source code for the actual Robot Framework test library.
 - `node/playwright-wrapper`, contains a wrapper for Playwirght that implements the grpc protocol, implemented in Typescript.
 - `node/dynamic-test-app`, contains a test application used in the acceptance tests, implemented in Typescript + React.
 - `protobuf`, contains the Protocol Buffer definitions used by the communication between the library and Playwirght wrapper.
 - `utest`, unit tests for the Python code.
 - `atest`, acceptance tests written with Robot Framework.

## Development environment

Install Python, nodejs and yarn. Make sure you have `make` available.
- https://www.python.org/downloads/
- https://nodejs.org/
- https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

Setup development environment with `make dev-env`.
This creates a Python virtualenv in .venv directory, and install both Python and
nodejs dependencies.

To update the dependencies use either `make dev-env` to update all or
alternatively `make .venv` or `make node-deps` to update only Python or nodejs
dependencies, respectively.

Make sure to run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the correct virtualenv.

Run `make build` or `yarn build` to build the Typescript code. Also run `make build`
after changes to the protocol (protos/playwright.proto) to re-generate protobuffer code.

### Development in Windows

Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and then install development tools with
`choco install sed make`.

After that, the development workflow should work as described in the previous chapter.
The only difference is that the virtualenv needs to be activated by running
`.venv\Scripts\activate` in the command prompt.

## Testing
There are both unit tests written with pytest and acceptance test written with
Robot Framework. These can be run manually with `make utest` and `make atest`.
To run continuously pytests in a watch mode `make utest-watch`.
To rerun failed tests you can use `make test-failed` The tests are also executed in a prepush hook.

## Running tests in docker container

Docker container builds a clean install package. This can be used to check that a builded package works correctly in a clean environment without development dependencies.

1. Build the container `make docker`
2. Run tests mounted from host machine `make docker-test`.
3. See results in `atest/output`

## Releasing
1. Ensure generated code and types are up to date with `make build`
2. Ensure tests and linting pass on CI
3. Check that you have permissions to release on Github and PyPi
4. Run `make version VERSION=<new_version>` to update the version information to both Python and Node components.
5. Use `make release` to create and release artifacts and upload to PyPi
6. Create Github release

## Code style
Python code style is enforced with flake8 and black. These are executed in a
precommit hook, but can also be invoked manually with `make lint-python`.

JS / TS code style is enforced with eslint. Lints are run in precommit hooks, but can be run manually with `make lint-node`.

## Architecture

There are 3 different interfaces that the library is targeting to use in browser automation and testing:

1. User interface: Interactions with DOM elements.
2. Internals of a webapp: State, Cookies, Storage, Methods.
3. Requests & Responses: Interface between a browser and servers .

Python Library <--> [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) <---> [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

You may interact with the bot by following the [bot usage guide](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage).

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of another developer, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
