Most important enhancements
===========================

Crawler fails if site has a link to a pdf (`#1463`_)
------------------------------------------------------

Crawling site did fail if there was link to pwf in the page. This is fixed in this release.

Add version binding between Playwright and Browser (`#591`_)
------------------------------------------------------------

In previous releases we did only tell minimum required Playwright version, which caused
problems with environment setups and sometimes some backwards incompatible issues. Starting
from this release, Playwright version is bind and library supports only one version of
Playwright.

Enable keyword documentation for JsExtentions (`#775`_)
-------------------------------------------------------

In previous releases we did support extending library by adding new keywords trough JS plugin,
but creating keyword documentation of the JS keywords not very well supported. This is now enhanced
and library also produces documentation from JS extension keywords.

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

With New Page keyword return also path to video (`#1424`_)
----------------------------------------------------------
New Page returned only the UUID of the page, with this release it returns an object
which also contains path to the video if one is created.
