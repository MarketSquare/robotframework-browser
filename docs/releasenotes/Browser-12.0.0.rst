Most important enhancements
===========================

Closing a browser should await for contexts of that browser to be closed (`#1133`_)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now we close context explicitly context associated to the browser. Also we create
possible trace file when contex is closed.

Select Options By Keyword throws TimeoutError: locator.elementHandle (`#1622`_)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This error happened when option element did not contain value attribute. If
option element does not contain value attribute, we try locate the option element
with the text in select.

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

Raise minimum required RF version to 4.1.3 (`#1769`_)
-----------------------------------------------------
Browser library uses IntEnums in some keywords arguments, but Robot Framework 4.0 has
a bug in the argument conversion. This bug has been fixed in Robot Framework 4.1 release
and therefore minimum required version is raised to 4.1.
