Most important enhancements
===========================

Documentation explaining automatic closing is not clear. (`#819`_)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation for automatic closing was unclear and caused confusing in users how it
actually works. Now the documentation has been to fixed and hopefully it causes less
confusing in the users.

Keyword 'Take Screenshot' could not be run on failure: 'NoneType' object is not iterable (`#868`_)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under certains contains with RF 4 test case name is not available and caused test name to be returned
as Python None. This did lead to unhandled exception in Python side and error in library. This is now
fixed.

Read  assertion operator table from assertion engine  (`#863`_)
---------------------------------------------------------------
In the past assertion operators documentation was hard coded in the library docs. Now the assertion operator
is read from the assertion engine tool and is dynamically updated when tool also updates.

Exposing Playwirght channel API for easier support for different browsers (`#865`_)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Playwright comes with inbuild Chromium browser, but starting from 1.10 release, it has been
possible to use preinstalled Chrome/Chromium Edge browsers with channel argument. This
is now exposed argument in Browser library side too.
