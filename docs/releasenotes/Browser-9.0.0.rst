Most important enhancements
===========================

- Pip does not clean inside site-packages/Browser/wrapper anymore when uninstalling (`#1253`_)
    - Sometimes pip fails to completely clean up site packages (depends on pip version and environment), now there is `rfbrowser clean-node` to run before pip uninstall to ensure cleanup
- Set Strict Mode keyword documentation is not correct.  (`#1320`_)
- Issue with keyword documentation example - Select Options By (`#1335`_)
- Take Screenshot doesn't process arguments correctly when run on failure (`#1356`_)
- Doc Keywords: Move closing context/page section into "Browser, Context, Page" section (`#1362`_)

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

- Take Screenshot doesn't process arguments correctly when run on failure (`#1356`_)
    - Register Keyword To Run On Failure now returns an object of the old Failure Handler instead of a string
