Most important enhancements
===========================

Assertion engine 0.1.0 breaks keyword Get Element State (`#1152`_)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Get Element State did not work correctly with default values the
keyword arguments, if assertion engine 0.1.0 or never was used.

This change is also slightly backwards incompatible, because now it
is mandatory to define both assertion operator and expected value.

Assertion should fail if expected value is given without operator (`#1142`_)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was actully bug in the assertion engine dependency, but now
this release requires assertion engine 0.2.0 or greater.

Keyword to get url in a page  (`#1167`_)
----------------------------------------
There is new keyword to get crawl pages urls.

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

When RF 4.1 out drop support RF 3.2 (`#1153`_)
----------------------------------------------
Support for Robot Framework 3.2 is dropped in this release. RF 3.2 or older
versions might still work, but they are not tested and therefore official
support is dropped.
