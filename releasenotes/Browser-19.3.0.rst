Most important enhancements
===========================

Stop Coverage keyword should tell if it could not find file defined in config_file argument in Start Coverage keyword (`#3990`_)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added better logging if the config_file argument file can not be found. Logging is enhanced in
both Start Coverage and Stop Coverage keywords.

Get Element States keyword returns incorrect state if elements is not input type (`#4037`_)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was bug how readonly state was handled in Get Element States keyword. Playwright
started raising an error if element is not input like and this handling was incorrectly
fixes in Browser library side. Now Get Element States keyword returns correct state, also
if element is disabled it is considered readonly.

Issues during python package installation via pip in docker image v19.2.0 (`#4034`_)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.2.0 release updated docker base image to Unbuntu Noble, made by Playwright team.
Because Noble prevents installation to system Python. In 19.2 release Browser library
forced installation to system Python. This caused issues with pip installation for people
using our container. Now Browser library is installed to Python virtual environent under
the pwuser, in .venv folder. Virtual environment is activated for the pwuser and
this should fix the installation issues for users.
