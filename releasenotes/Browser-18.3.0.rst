Most important enhancements
===========================

Use tidy to fix deprecated keyword: Wait Until Network Is Idle to Wait For Load State (`#3437`_)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`rfbrowser transform` commands helps user to transfors deprecated keywords to new format.
Currently we support transforming `Wait Until Network Is Idle` to `Wait For Load State`. But
it might be possible in future to extend support for other deprecated keywords.

Support translation for keyword and documentation. (`#3497`_)
-------------------------------------------------------------
With help of `PythonLibCore`_ library now support translating keywords names and documentation to other
langueges than English. Translation to other langueges needs support for community by creating Python
packages, exampe project is created `Finnish`_

Xray compatibility: Add robot-seleniumlibrary-screenshot class to render embedded images (`#3487`_)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When embedding screenhot to log.html file, class="robot-seleniumlibrary-screenshot" attribute is added
to the <img> tag. This adds supports for XRay.
