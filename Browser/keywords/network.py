          - ``url`` The request url, e.g. ``/api/foo``.
          - ``method`` The HTTP method for the request. Defaults to GET.
          - ``body`` The request body. GET requests cannot have a body. If the body can be parsed as JSON,
          the ``Content-Type`` header for the request will be automatically set to ``application/json``.
          Defaults to None.
          - ``headers`` A dictionary of additional request headers. Defaults to None.

        The response is a Python dictionary with following attributes:
          - ``status`` <int> The status code of the response.
          - ``statusText`` <str> Status text corresponding to ``status``, e.g OK or INTERNAL SERVER ERROR.
          - ``body`` <dict> | <str> The response body. If the body can be parsed as a JSON obejct,
          it will be returned as Python dictionary, otherwise it is returned as a string.
          - ``headers`` <dict> A dictionary containing all response headers.
          - ``ok`` <bool> Whether the request was successfull, i.e. the ``status`` is range 200-299.
