        == Matcher Examples: ==

        === Glob-Pattern: ===

        Glob-Patterns are strings that can contain wildcards. The following wildcards are supported:

        Possible wildcards/patterns are:
        - ``*`` matches any number of characters, except ``/``
        - ``**`` matches any number of characters, including ``/``
        - ``?`` matches one character, except ``/``
        - ``[abc]`` matches one character in the brackets (in this example ``a``, ``b`` or ``c``)
        - ``[a-z]`` matches one character in the range (in this example ``a`` to ``z``)
        - ``{foo,bar,baz}`` matches one of the strings in the braces (in this example ``foo``, ``bar`` or ``baz``)

        Example:
        | `Wait For Response`    **/api/get/text    # matches any request with url ending with /api/get/text. example: https://browser.fi/api/get/text

        === RegExp: ===

        Regular Expressions are JavaScript regular expressions encapsulated in ``/`` with optional following flags:
        Be aware that backslashes need to be escaped in Robot Framework, e.g. ``\\\\w`` instead of ``\\w``.
        See [https://regex101.com|regex101] for more information on Regular Expressions.

        Example:
        | `Wait For Response`    /http://\\\\w+:\\\\d+/api/get/text/i    # matches any request with url ending with /api/get/text and containing http:// followed by any word and port. example: http://localhost:8080/api/get/text

        === JavaScript Arrow-Function: ===

        JavaScript Arrow-Functions are anonymous JavaScript functions that receive the
        [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-response|Response] object and return a boolean.

        Example:
        | `Wait For Response`    response => response.url() === 'http://localhost/api/post' && response.status() === 200    # matches any response with url http://localhost/api/post and status code 200

        == Robot Examples: ==

        Synchronous Example:
        | `Click`                \\#delayed_request    # Creates response which should be waited before next actions
        | `Wait For Response`    matcher=/http://\\\\w+:\\\\d+/api/get/text/i
        | `Click`                \\#save

        Asynchronous Example:
        | ${promise} =    `Promise To`    `Wait For Response`    timeout=60s
        | `Click`           \\#delayed_request    # Creates response which should be waited before pressing save.
        | `Click`           \\#next
        | `Wait For`        ${promise}            # Waits for the response
        | `Click`           \\#save

        JavaScript Function Example:
        | `Click`               \\#delayed_request    # Creates response which should be waited before pressing save.
        | `Wait For Response`   [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-response/|response] => response.url().endsWith('json') && response.request().method() === 'GET'
