        The handler will click the element indicated by `click_selector`.

        When testing a web page, sometimes unexpected overlkays, exaple "Accept Coocies" dialog
        might appear and block the interaction with the page, like `Click` keyword. These
        overlays can be problematic to handle, because they might appear randomly in the page.
        This keyword allows to create automatic method, which will close those overlays by
        clicking the element indicated by ``click_selector``. Handler is activaed when
        element indicated by ``selector`` is visible. For furhter information, see Playwright's
        [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-add-locator-handler|addLocatorHandler]
        method.

        | =Arguments= | =Description= |
        | ``selector`` | Is the selector to the element which indicated that locator handler should be called. |
        | ``noWaitAfter`` | By default, after calling the handler Playwright will wait until the overlay becomes hidden, and only then library will continue with the action/assertion that triggered the handler. This option allows to opt-out of this behavior, so that overlay can stay visible after the handler has run. |
        | ``times`` | Is the number of times to how often locator handler is is called. None is unlimited. |
        | ``click_selector`` | Is the selector to the element to be clicked. |
        | ``click_clickCount`` | Is the number of times to click the element. |
        | ``click_delay`` | Time to wait between mousedown and mouseup in milliseconds. Defaults to 0. |
        | ``click_force`` | Whether to bypass checks and dispatch the event directly. Defaults to false. |

        The arguments `click_selector`, `click_clickCount`, `click_delay` and `click_force` are same as
        `Click` keyword. The `selector`, `noWaitAfter` and `times` are for the locator handler. The
        handler is tied to the active page, if there is need to add handler to another page, this keyword
        needs to be called separetly for each page. If the `times` argument is set to positive value,
        the locator handler is removed after the handler has been called the specified number of times.

        Example add locator handler to click button with id="ButtonInOverlay" when id=Overlay is visible:
        | `New Page`    ${URL}
        | `Add Locator Handler Click`    id=Overlay    id=ButtonInOverlay     # Add locator handler to page
        | `Type Text`    id:username    user    # If element with id=Overlay appears, the handler will click the button id=ButtonInOverlay
        | `Type Text`    id:password    password    # Or if overlay is visible here, then handler is called here
        | `Click`    id:login
        | `Remove Locator Handler`    id:button    # Removes the locator handler from page

        When element indicated by `selector` is visible, the handler will perform the actions specified

        | =Arguments= | =Description= |
        | ``selector`` | Is the selector to the element which indicated that locator handler should be called. |
        | ``noWaitAfter`` | By default, after calling the handler Playwright will wait until the overlay becomes hidden, and only then library will continue with the action/assertion that triggered the handler.

        | ``times`` | Is the number of times to how often locator handler is is called. None is unlimited. |
        | ``handler_spec`` | Is a list of dictionaries which defines the actions to be performed. |

        The `handler_spec` is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary defines one action.
        The dictionary must contain the key `action` which defines the action to be
        performed. The action can be one of the following:
        [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-click|click],
        [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-fill|fill],
        [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-check|check] and
        [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-uncheck|uncheck]. Action is also case
        insensitive. The dictionary must also contain key `selector` which defines the element
        to be interacted with. The `fill` action must also contain the key `value` which defines
        the value to be filled in the element. Additional keys are passed to the action as
        keyword arguments. Example for the
        [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-click|click] action refer to the Playwright's
        documentation which options are posisble.

        The `selector`, `noWaitAfter` and `times` are for the locator handler
        [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-add-locator-handler|method].
        The handler is tied to the active page, if there is need to add handler to another page, this keyword
        needs to be called separetly for each page. If the `times` argument is set to positive value,
        the locator handler is removed after the handler has been called the specified number of times.

        Running the handler will alter your page state mid-test. For example it will change the currently
        focused element and move the mouse. Make sure that keywords that run after the handler are
        self-contained and do not rely on the focus and mouse state being unchanged.

        Please note that the automatic argument conversion is not done for the `handler_spec` dictionary.
        This is because Robot Framework does not that values inside the dictionary are actually
        arguments to a seperate Playwright API call. Therefore user is responsible of the user to convert
        the values to the correct type. Example if timeout is needed, the value must be converted to a number
        in Robot Framework test data side.

        Example adds locator handler to fill input id=overlayInput with value "Hello" and click
        element id=OverlayCloseButton when id=Overlay is visible:
        | `New Page`    ${URL}
        | VAR    &{handler_spec_fill}
        | ...    action=Fill
        | ...    selector=id=overlayInput
        | ...    value=Hello
        | VAR    &{handler_spec_click}
        | ...    action=click
        | ...    selector=id=OverlayCloseButton
        | `Add Locator Handler Custom`
        | ...    id=overlay
        | ...    [${handler_spec_fill}, ${handler_spec_click}]
        | `Type Text`    id:username    user    # If element with id=Overlay appears, the handler will click the button id=ButtonInOverlay
        | `Type Text`    id:password    password    # Or if overlay is visible here, then handler is called here
        | `Click`    id:login

        Example with click and different options and types:
        | VAR    &{handler_spec}
        | ...    action=CLICK    # Action is case insensitive
        | ...    selector=id=OverlayCloseButton
        | ...    button=left
        | ...    clickCount=${1}
        | ...    delay=${0.1}
        | ...    force=${True}
        | Add Locator Handler Custom    id=overlay    [${handler_spec}]

        The keyword can only handle click, fill, check and uncheck Playwright API calls. If there is a
        need for more complex interactions, it is recommended to create a custom js extension to handle
        the interactions.

        Example:
        | async function customLocatorHandler(locator, pageLocator, clickLocator, page) {
        |     console.log("Adding custom locator handler for: " + locator);
        |     const pageLocator = page.locator(locator).first();
        |     await page.addLocatorHandler(
        |         pageLocator,
        |         async () => {
        |             console.log("Handling custom locator: " + clickLocator);
        |             // More complex interactions can be added here
        |             await page.locator(clickLocator).click();
        |         }
        |     );
