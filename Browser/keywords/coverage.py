        | ``config_file`` | Optional path to [https://www.npmjs.com/package/monocart-coverage-reports#options|options file] |
        | ``coverage_type`` | Type of coverage to start. Default is `all`. |
        | ``path`` | Absolute or relative directory path (relative to ``${OUTPUT_DIR}/browser/coverage/``) where the coverage is store in a directory with the page id name. |
        | ``raw`` | Whether to save raw coverage data. Default is `False`. |
        | ``reportAnonymousScripts`` | Whether to report anonymous scripts. Default is `False`. Only valid for JS coverage. |
        | ``resetOnNavigation`` | Whether to reset coverage on navigation. Default is `True`. |

        The `coverage_type` can be one of the following:
        - ``all``: Both [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-coverage/#coverage-start-css-coverage|CSS] and [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-coverage/#coverage-start-js-coverage|JS].
        - ``css``: [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-coverage/#coverage-start-css-coverage|CSS].
        - ``js``: [https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-coverage/#coverage-start-js-coverage|JS].

        Coverage must started when page is open and before any action is
        performed on the page. Coverage will be stored when calling `Stop Coverage` keyword
        or page or context is closed. This is done automatically when using the auto closing.

        The `raw` argument saves the raw coverage data in the coverage folder. The raw data
        is needed to combine multiple coverage reports to single report. Singel report can
        be created with `rfbrowser coverage /path/to/basefolder/ /path/to/outputfolder/`
        command. Pleaee note that the `raw` argument is ignored if the `config_file`
        is defined. In this case user is responsible to also set the raw reporter
        in the config file. To see more details about combining coverage data, run:
        `rfbrowser coverage --help` command.

        Example:
        | `New Page`
        | `Start Coverage`
        | `Go To`    ${LOGIN_URL}
        | Do Something In The Page

        The input_folder argument is the base folder where the coverage reports are
        located. Keyword will look into each subfolder and if the subfolder
        contains "raw" folder, it will use data from the "raw" folder for
        combined reports.

        The output_folder argument is the folder where the combined report is saved.
        If folder does not exist, it is created. If folder exists, it's content
        is deleted before report is created.

        The output_folder and input_folder must be full paths to the folders.

        The config_file argument is optional and can be used to provide a path to a
        monocart-coverage-reports options file. For more details see:
        https://www.npmjs.com/package/monocart-coverage-reports#config-file

        The name argument is optional and can be used to provide a name for the
        combined report.

        The reports argument is optional and can be used to provide a list of
        reporters to create. Default is 'v8'.

        The keyword combines only the raw reports. To get raw reports,
        `Start Coverage` keyword must be called with `raw=True` argument.
        Keyword should be used when there is a need to combine multiple reports
        to single report. For example, when tests are run in multiple pages, the
        example in below demonstrates how to use the keyword.
