        """Sets the keyword to execute, when a Browser keyword fails.

        ``keyword`` is the name of a keyword that will be executed if a
        Browser keyword fails. It is possible to use any available
        keyword, including user keywords or keywords from other libraries.
        ``args`` are the arguments to the keyword if any.

        The initial keyword to use is set when `importing` the library, and
        the keyword that is used by default is `Take Screenshot`.
        Taking a screenshot when something failed is a very useful
        feature, but notice that it can slow down the execution.

        It is possible to use string ``NONE`` or any other robot falsy name,
        case-insensitively, as well as Python ``None`` to disable this
        feature altogether.

        This keyword returns an object which contains the the previously
        registered failure keyword. The return value can be always used to
        restore the original value later. The returned object contains
        keyword name and the possible arguments used to for the keyword.

        Example:
        | `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`    Take Screenshot
        | ${previous kw}=    `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`    NONE
        | `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`    ${previous kw}
        | `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`    Take Screenshot    fullPage=True
        | `Register Keyword To Run On Failure`    Take Screenshot    failure-{index}    fullPage=True
