    """Browser library is a browser automation library for Robot Framework.

    This is hte keyword documentation for Browser library. For information
    about installation, support, and more please visit the
    [https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-playwright|project pages].
    For more information about Robot Framework itself, see [https://robotframework.org|robotframework.org].

    Browser library uses
    [https://github.com/microsoft/playwright|Playwright Node module]
    to automate [https://www.chromium.org/Home|Chromium],
    [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/|Firefox]
    and [https://webkit.org/|WebKit] with a single library.

    == Table of contents ==

    %TOC%

    = Finding elements =

    All keywords in hte library that need to interact with an element
    on a web page take an argument typically named ``selector`` that specifies
    how to find the element.

    == Selector syntax ==

    Browser library supports the same selector strategies as the underlying
    Playwright node module: xpath, css, id and text. The strategy can either
    be explicitly specified with a prefix or the strategy can be implicit.

    === Implicit selector strategy ===

    The default selector strategy is `css`. If selector does not contain
    one of the know selector strategies, `css`, `xpath`, `id` or `text` it is
    assumed to contain css selector. Also `selectors` starting with `//`
    considered as xpath selectors.

    Examples:

    | `Click` | span > button | # Use css selector strategy the element.   |
    | `Click` | //span/button | # Use xpath selector strategy the element. |

    === Explicit selector strategy ===

    The explicit selector strategy is specified with a prefix using syntax
    ``strategy=value``. Spaces around the separator are ignored, so
    ``css=foo``, ``css= foo`` and ``css = foo`` are all equivalent.


    Selector strategies that are supported by default are listed in the table
    below.

    | = Strategy = |     = Match based on =     |         = Example =            |
    | css          | CSS selector.              | ``css=div#example``            |
    | xpath        | XPath expression.          | ``xpath=//div[@id="example"]`` |
    | text         | Browser text engine.       | ``text=Login``                 |

    == Finding elements inside frames ==

    By default, selector chains do not cross frame boundaries. It means that a
    simple CSS selector is not able to select and element located inside an iframe
    or a frameset. For this usecase, there is a special selector ``>>>`` which can
    be used to combine a selector for the frame and a selector for an element
    inside a frame.

    Given this simple pseudo html snippet:
    ``<iframe name="iframe" src="src.html"><button id="btn">Click Me</button></iframe>``,
    here's a keyword call that clicks the button inside the frame.

    | Click  | iframe[name="iframe"] >>> #btn  |

    The selectors on the left and right side of ``>>>`` can be any valid selectors.

    = Assertions =

    Keywords that accept arguments ``assertion_operator`` and ``assertion_expected``
    can optionally assert.
    Currently supported assertion operators are:

    |      = Operator =               |              = Description =                          |
    | ``==`` or ``should be``         | equal                                                 |
    | ``!=`` or ``should not be``     | not equal                                             |
    | ``>``                           | greater than                                          |
    | ``>=``                          | greater than or equal                                 |
    | ``<``                           | less than                                             |
    | ``<=``                          | less than or equal                                    |
    | ``*=`` or ``contains``          | for checking that a value contains an element         |
    | ``matches``                     | for matching against a regular expression.            |
    | ``^=`` or ``should start with`` | starts with                                           |
    | ``$=`` or ``should end with``   | ends with                                             |
    | ``validate``                    | use BuiltIn Evaluate. Access to actual with ``value`` |

    Assertion value can be any valid robot value, and the keywords will provide an error
    message if the assertion fails.

    = The 'then' closure =

    Keywords that accept arguments ``assertion_operator`` and ``assertion_expected``
    can optionally also use ``then`` closure to modify the returned value with
    BuiltIn Evaluate. Actual value can be accessed with ``value``.

    For example ``Get Title  then  'TITLE: '+value``.
    See
    [https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html#Evaluating%20expressions|
    Builtin Evaluating expressions]
    for more info on the syntax.
