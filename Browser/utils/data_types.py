    == AltText ==
    All images should have an alt attribute that describes the image. You can locate an image based on the text alternative using page.getByAltText().

    For example, consider the following DOM structure.
    | <img alt="playwright logo" src="/img/playwright-logo.svg" width="100" />

    == Label ==
    Allows locating input elements by the text of the associated ``<label>`` or ``aria-labelledby`` element, or by the ``aria-label`` attribute.

    For example, this method will find inputs by label "Username" and "Password" in the following DOM:

    | <input aria-label="Username">
    | <label for="password-input">Password:</label>
    | <input id="password-input">

    == Placeholder ==
    Allows locating input elements by the placeholder text.

    Example:
    | <input type="email" placeholder="name@example.com" />

    == TestId ==
    Locate element by the test id.

    Currently only the exact attribute ``data-testid`` is supported.

    Example:
    | <button data-testid="directions">Itin√©raire</button>

    == Text ==
    Allows locating elements that contain given text.

    Matching by text always normalizes whitespace, even with exact match.
    For example, it turns multiple spaces into one, turns line breaks into spaces and ignores leading and trailing whitespace.
    Input elements of the type button and submit are matched by their value instead of the text content.
    For example, locating by text "Log in" matches <input type=button value="Log in">.

    == Title ==
    Allows locating elements by their title attribute.

    Example:
    | <img alt="playwright logo" src="/img/playwright-logo.svg" title="Playwright" width="100" />

    Is a scope finished, this scoped setting, like timeout, will no longer be used and the previous higher scope setting applies again.

    Live Times:

    - A ``Global`` scope will live forever until it is overwritten by another Global scope.
      Or locally temporarily overridden by a more narrow scope.
    - A ``Suite`` scope will locally override the Global scope and
      live until the end of the Suite within it is set, or if it is overwritten
      by a later setting with Global or same scope.
      Children suite does inherit the setting from the parent suite but also may have
      its own local Suite setting that then will be inherited to its children suites.
    - A ``Test`` or ``Task`` scope will be inherited from its parent suite but when set,
      lives until the end of that particular test or task.

    A new set higher order scope will always remove the lower order scope which may be in charge.

    that test is and removes the Test scope that may have been in place."""
